# ContainerFactory
> Managing dependencies in PHP applications should be easy. Likewise, the IOC container should
> be easy to use, and robust. It shouldn't take programmatic arm twisting to mount, and access
> dependencies within an application. 
> 
> With that said, I've created a PSR-11 compatible dependency container in hopes of building a
> portable option with a simple, intuitive, and - most of all - practical, accessible API. The
> goal of this container is to give developers easy access to all their dependencies in their
> applications, without the headaches.
